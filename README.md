# beanOS 
This operating system is built on the foundations of [Bare Bones](https://wiki.osdev.org/Bare_Bones) and [Meaty Skeleton](https://wiki.osdev.org/Meaty_Skeleton)
The goal of this operating system is to make a suitable interface for creating userspace programs such as terminal applications such as mkdir all the way to 3d games like doom.
