# beanOS 
This operating system is built on the foundations of [Limine Bare Bones](https://wiki.osdev.org/Limine_Bare_Bones#src/main.c).
The goal of this operating system is to make a suitable interface for creating userspace programs such as terminal applications such as mkdir all the way to 3d games like doom.
This will be done via a unix-like interface to create all the userspace programs
